		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a WordPress &amp; Front-end Web Developer. I went to school and graduated with a degree in Sociology. I later realized that I did not want to use that degree it wasn't what I was passionate about. One day I found an article about Front-end Web Development and then that was it I was hooked. I started to find as much as I could about Web Development. At this point I know that I have enough knowledge to start my career in Web Development abd if I do not know something I will take the time to figure it out. Thiis is what I want to do for the rest of my life and I will always be happy about it.
